============================================================
ISAAC+: Compared with classic PBFT
============================================================

Basically the well-known principles of PBFT are,

* Consensus tries to reach the majority by voting.
* Each view has a leader and it proposes the next block.
* Each node validates and votes the next block of leader.

ISAAC+ is also based these rules and has some additional rules,

* Each round has a proposer(leader) and it proposes proposal, which is the contents of next block.
* Each acting suffrage group member validates the proposal and votes the established result of proposal.

    * If acting round is failed to get agreement, all the suffrage group members move to next round.
* To start new round, all the nodes in acting suffrage group must agree at the next *INIT* stage.

    * If network is failed to agree at *INIT* stage, suffrage group members try to get agreement of *INIT* stage.

Like PBFT, the recommended agreement threshold within acting suffrage group is at least 67% and to keep consensus going in the network level, the recommended number of nodes should be greater than 4. 4 nodes means the consensus will be going if 1 node fails at most. To make network to be more sustainable against the failed nodes, the number of nodes should be increased by the rule, ``3F+1`` (``F`` is the number of failed node)

Phases and Stages
------------------------------------------------------------

Traditionally PBFT has 4 phases, each phase represents how the incoming request from client reaches to the consensus.

1. *Request*
2. *Pre-Prepare*
3. *Prepare*
4. *Commit*

ISAAC+ has also similar 3 phases(in ISAAC+, it is called voting stage),

1. *INIT*
2. *SIGN*
3. *ACCPET*

Each stage does have similar meaning.

*INIT*
    * All the node of suffrage group members participate.
    * At this stage, suffrage group members will get agreement on the new block and it's round, which is voted at the previous *ACCEPT* stage.
    * When the agreement is reached, the next block will be established and start new round for next block

*SIGN*
    * Only members of acting suffrage group participate.
    * Similar to the *Pre-Prepare*, the selected proposer(leader in PBFT) broadcasts its proposal to the network
    * Similar to the *Prepare*, each node will validate the proposal

*ACCEPT*
    * Only members of acting suffrage group participate.
    * Similar to the *Prepare*, when *ACCEPT* stage gets agreement, the new block is ready to established and ready to move next block.

Unlike the classic PBFT, ISAAC+ will establish the new block at the *INIT* stage by all the member of suffrage group, this means all the members of suffrage group should agree the new block for establishing it.
